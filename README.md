# BackerUP
Contains source code for the BackerUP application 

First off, thanks for looking at this whomeever you may be. Regardless though, this contains a brief outline of the current state of the program
---------------------
PROGRAM FUNCTION:
- the BackerUP python application is made to make incremental backups more simple and easier
- A simple GUI interface makes user interaction simple and avoids the more intimidating CLI that I myself prefer out of habit
- A thread is dedicated to each backup process (this may need to be altered, very experimental)
- Backups can inslude a single file, or an entire drive

THIRD-PARTY MODULES USED:

CURRENT STATE
- Program is very much a personal project of mine that I've enjoyed the challenges and learning expeirence of GUIs, file and system work
- Its far from perfect, but feel free to fork or clone
